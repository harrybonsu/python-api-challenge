## Written description of observable trends based on the data.

1. From the data, it can be observed that as one moves away in either direction from the equator, the temperature begins to drop. 

2. The decrease in temperature is however relatively high in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere making it colder in the former than the latter. 

3. Humidity and cloudiness on the other hand appears to be evenly spread across both sides of the equator.
